# Python Multiple Inheritance Example
# Letâ€™s demonstrate a short example of python multiple inheritance.
#The classes Person and Student are superclass here and Resident is the subclass. 
# The class Resident extends both Person and Student to inherit the properties of both classes

		
#definition of the class starts here  
class Person:  
    #defining constructor  
    def __init__(self, personName, personAge):  
        self.name = personName  
        self.age = personAge  
  
    #defining class methods  
    def showName(self):  
        print(self.name)  
  
    def showAge(self):  
        print(self.age)  
  
    #end of class definition  
  
# defining another class  
class Student: # Person is the  
    def __init__(self, studentId):  
        self.studentId = studentId  
  
    def getId(self):  
        return self.studentId  
  
  
class Resident(Person, Student): # extends both Person and Student class  
    def __init__(self, name, age, id):  
        Person.__init__(self, name, age)
